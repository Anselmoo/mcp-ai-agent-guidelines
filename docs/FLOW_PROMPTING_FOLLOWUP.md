## Issue Reference

- **Original Issue**: [#122 - Follow-up: Address feedback from flow-based prompting strategies (claude-flow) PR](https://github.com/Anselmoo/mcp-ai-agent-guidelines/issues/122)
- **Parent Issue**: [#100](https://github.com/Anselmoo/mcp-ai-agent-guidelines/issues/100)
- **Original PRs**: [#120](https://github.com/Anselmoo/mcp-ai-agent-guidelines/pull/120), [#121](https://github.com/Anselmoo/mcp-ai-agent-guidelines/pull/121)

## Improvements Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Code Documentation

**Files Modified:**
- `src/tools/prompt/prompt-flow-builder.ts`
- `src/tools/prompt/prompt-chaining-builder.ts`

**Improvements:**
- Added comprehensive JSDoc comments explaining architecture and design patterns
- Documented integration with Serena memory patterns
- Explained node types, validation logic, and execution flow
- Added inline comments for complex algorithms (BFS for reachability)
- Fixed linting issues (removed unused variables, replaced non-null assertions with safe checks)
- Referenced claude-flow architecture inspiration in comments
- Linked to Serena best practices in execution guides

**Key Comments Added:**
```typescript
/**
 * Prompt Flow Builder - Creates declarative, graph-based AI workflows
 *
 * Inspired by claude-flow's architecture, this tool enables complex prompting strategies through:
 * - Declarative flow definition with nodes and edges
 * - Conditional branching and loops for adaptive behavior
 * - Parallel execution for independent operations
 * - Automatic visualization and execution guides
 *
 * Integration with Serena patterns:
 * - Memory-aware execution (stores flow results for context retention)
 * - Mode-appropriate flow design (planning vs. execution flows)
 * - Symbol-based operations (flows can reference code symbols)
 */
```

### 2. Expanded Documentation Examples

**File Modified:** `docs/FLOW_PROMPTING_EXAMPLES.md`

**New Sections Added:**
- **Memory-Optimized Flow with Serena Patterns**: Shows mode switching and project memory integration
- **Chaining with Error Recovery**: Demonstrates resilient workflows with fallback strategies
- **Performance Optimization Patterns**: Complete section covering:
  - Context window management with memory-context-optimizer
  - Parallel execution for independent tasks
  - Caching and reuse with project memories
  - Progressive refinement with iteration loops

**Example Pattern:**
```typescript
// Memory-optimized flow with context compression
await promptChainingBuilder({
  steps: [
    { name: "Extract", prompt: "Extract key points", outputKey: "points" },
    {
      name: "Compress",
      prompt: "Use memory-context-optimizer to compress {{points}}",
      outputKey: "optimized"
    },
    { name: "Analyze", prompt: "Analyze using {{optimized}}" }
  ]
});
```

### 3. Comprehensive Integration Guide

**New File:** `docs/FLOW_SERENA_INTEGRATION.md`

**Contents:**
- **5 Integration Patterns:**
  1. Planning-First Workflow (mode switching before/after flow design)
  2. Memory-Aware Chaining (using project memories in chains)
  3. Semantic-Aware Flows (integrating symbol-based analysis)
  4. Context-Optimized Long Workflows (memory optimization between steps)
  5. Multi-Mode Workflow Orchestration (mode switching throughout execution)

- **Best Practices:**
  - Always start with planning mode
  - Leverage project memories for consistency
  - Optimize context window usage
  - Combine semantic analysis with flows
  - Switch modes appropriately

- **Common Patterns:**
  - Incremental Feature Development
  - Large-Scale Refactoring
  - Comprehensive Code Review

- **Performance Tips:**
  - Parallel execution strategies
  - Context compression techniques
  - Caching mechanisms
  - Incremental processing
  - Mode switching optimization

- **Troubleshooting Guide:**
  - Context window overflow â†’ Add memory optimization
  - Slow execution â†’ Use parallel nodes
  - Inconsistent results â†’ Load project memories
  - Hard to debug â†’ Enable visualization
  - Lost context â†’ Use project-onboarding

### 4. Updated README

**File Modified:** `README.md`

**Changes:**
- Enhanced flow-based prompting section with better organization
- Added reference to new integration guide
- Improved visibility of Serena integration capabilities

**New Content:**
```markdown
> **ðŸŒŠ NEW: Flow-Based Prompting** â€” Advanced prompting strategies inspired by
> [@ruvnet/claude-flow](https://github.com/ruvnet/claude-flow) including prompt
> chaining, declarative flows, and dynamic orchestration.

```

### 5. Enhanced MCP Resources

**File Modified:** `src/resources/structured.ts`

**Changes:**
- Added "Serena Integration" section to flow-based-prompting resource
- Included reference to FLOW_SERENA_INTEGRATION.md guide
- Listed integration patterns available via MCP
- Added links to both claude-flow and Serena projects

**New Resource Content:**
```typescript
{
  type: "heading",
  level: 2,
  text: "Serena Integration"
},
{
  type: "paragraph",
  text: "Combine flow-based prompting with Serena memory patterns for
         context-aware, persistent workflows..."
},
{
  type: "list",
  items: [
    "Memory-aware chaining: Use project-onboarding memories in chains",
    "Mode-appropriate flows: Switch modes during execution",
    "Semantic-aware flows: Integrate semantic-code-analyzer",
    "Context optimization: Use memory-context-optimizer between steps",
    "Multi-mode orchestration: Adapt mode based on current phase"
  ]
}
