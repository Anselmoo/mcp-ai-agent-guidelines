# Advanced Prompting Strategies Examples

This document demonstrates the new flow-based prompting capabilities inspired by claude-flow.

## 1. Prompt Chaining Example

### Security Analysis Chain

```typescript
// Multi-step security analysis workflow
await promptChainingBuilder({
  chainName: "Security Analysis Pipeline",
  description: "Comprehensive security review with progressive refinement",
  context: "Web application codebase security audit",
  globalVariables: {
    compliance: "OWASP Top 10",
    severity_threshold: "medium"
  },
  steps: [
    {
      name: "Initial Scan",
      description: "Automated vulnerability detection",
      prompt: "Scan the codebase for common security vulnerabilities including SQL injection, XSS, CSRF, and insecure dependencies",
      outputKey: "vulnerabilities",
      errorHandling: "abort"
    },
    {
      name: "Risk Assessment",
      description: "Evaluate severity and impact",
      prompt: "For each vulnerability in {{vulnerabilities}}, assess:\n1. Severity level (low/medium/high/critical)\n2. Potential impact\n3. Exploitability\n4. Affected components",
      dependencies: ["vulnerabilities"],
      outputKey: "risk_analysis",
      errorHandling: "retry"
    },
    {
      name: "Compliance Check",
      description: "Verify against compliance standards",
      prompt: "Map the identified issues in {{risk_analysis}} to {{compliance}} requirements and identify any compliance gaps",
      dependencies: ["risk_analysis"],
      outputKey: "compliance_report",
      errorHandling: "skip"
    },
    {
      name: "Remediation Plan",
      description: "Generate actionable fixes",
      prompt: "Create a prioritized remediation plan for {{risk_analysis}} including:\n- Quick wins (< 1 day)\n- Short-term fixes (1-5 days)\n- Long-term improvements (> 5 days)\nProvide code examples for top 3 issues",
      dependencies: ["risk_analysis", "compliance_report"],
      errorHandling: "abort"
    }
  ],
  executionStrategy: "sequential",
  includeVisualization: true
});
```

### Code Review Chain

```typescript
await promptChainingBuilder({
  chainName: "Adaptive Code Review",
  steps: [
    {
      name: "Static Analysis",
      prompt: "Perform static code analysis checking for:\n- Code complexity\n- Duplicate code\n- Dead code\n- Style violations",
      outputKey: "static_results"
    },
    {
      name: "Performance Analysis",
      prompt: "Analyze {{static_results}} for performance issues:\n- Inefficient algorithms (O(nÂ²) or worse)\n- Memory leaks\n- Unnecessary re-renders\n- Network waterfalls",
      dependencies: ["static_results"],
      outputKey: "performance_issues"
    },
    {
      name: "Recommendations",
      prompt: "Generate specific, actionable recommendations based on {{static_results}} and {{performance_issues}}. Include code snippets.",
      dependencies: ["static_results", "performance_issues"]
    }
  ]
});
```

## 2. Prompt Flow Examples

    { from: "merge_reports", to: "final_report" }
  ]
});
```

## 3. Integration with Existing Tools

### Combined Workflow: Hierarchical + Chaining

```typescript
// Step 1: Select appropriate hierarchy level
const levelResult = await hierarchyLevelSelector({
  taskDescription: "Implement OAuth2 authentication with JWT tokens",
  agentCapability: "intermediate",
  taskComplexity: "complex"
});

// Step 2: Build hierarchical prompt
const basePrompt = await hierarchicalPromptBuilder({
  context: levelResult.context,
  goal: levelResult.goal,
  requirements: levelResult.requirements,
  techniques: ["chain-of-thought", "prompt-chaining"]
});

// Step 3: Create implementation chain
const implChain = await promptChainingBuilder({
  chainName: "OAuth2 Implementation Chain",
  context: basePrompt.content[0].text,
  steps: [
    {
      name: "Design Phase",
      prompt: "Design the OAuth2 flow, token structure, and security measures",
      outputKey: "design"
    },
    {
      name: "Security Review",
      prompt: "Review {{design}} for security issues, especially token storage and CSRF protection",
      dependencies: ["design"],
      outputKey: "security_feedback"
    },
    {
      name: "Implementation",
      prompt: "Implement the OAuth2 system incorporating {{security_feedback}}",
      dependencies: ["design", "security_feedback"],
      outputKey: "code"
    },
    {
      name: "Testing",
      prompt: "Generate comprehensive tests for {{code}} covering auth flows and edge cases",
      dependencies: ["code"]
    }
  ]
});
```

### Memory-Optimized Flow with Serena Patterns

```typescript
// Step 1: Switch to planning mode
await modeSwitcher({
  targetMode: "planning",
  context: "ide-assistant",
  reason: "Design flow architecture before implementation"
});

// Step 2: Load project context (Serena pattern)
const onboarding = await projectOnboarding({
  projectPath: "/path/to/project",
  projectName: "My App",
  projectType: "application",
  analysisDepth: "standard",
  includeMemories: true
});

// Step 3: Create memory-optimized flow
const flow = await promptFlowBuilder({
  flowName: "Context-Aware Code Refactoring",
  description: "Refactor codebase with project-specific context and memory optimization",
  variables: {
    architecture: onboarding.memories.architecture,
    conventions: onboarding.memories.codeConventions
  },
  nodes: [
    {
      id: "load_context",
      type: "prompt",
      name: "Load Project Context",
      config: {
        prompt: "Load project memories and recent changes from {{architecture}}"
      }
    },
    {
      id: "analyze",
      type: "prompt",
      name: "Semantic Analysis",
      config: {
        prompt: "Use semantic-code-analyzer to identify refactoring opportunities"
      }
    },
    {
      id: "optimize_memory",
      type: "transform",
      name: "Optimize Context",
      config: {
        transform: "Use memory-context-optimizer to compress context for next steps"
      }
    },
    {
      id: "refactor",
      type: "prompt",
      name: "Apply Refactoring",
      config: {
        prompt: "Refactor code following {{conventions}} and maintaining {{architecture}}"
      }
    }
  ],
  edges: [
    { from: "load_context", to: "analyze" },
    { from: "analyze", to: "optimize_memory" },
    { from: "optimize_memory", to: "refactor" }
  ]
});

// Step 4: Switch to editing mode for execution
await modeSwitcher({
  currentMode: "planning",
  targetMode: "editing",
  context: "ide-assistant"
});
```

### Chaining with Error Recovery

```typescript
await promptChainingBuilder({
  chainName: "Resilient API Integration",
  description: "Build API integration with fallback strategies",
  steps: [
    {
      name: "API Discovery",
      prompt: "Analyze API documentation and identify endpoints",
      outputKey: "endpoints",
      errorHandling: "retry" // Retry on failure
    },
    {
      name: "Schema Validation",
      prompt: "Validate request/response schemas for {{endpoints}}",
      dependencies: ["endpoints"],
      outputKey: "schemas",
      errorHandling: "skip" // Skip on failure, continue with partial results
    },
    {
      name: "Implementation",
      prompt: "Implement API client using {{endpoints}} and {{schemas}}",
      dependencies: ["endpoints", "schemas"],
      errorHandling: "abort" // Critical step - abort chain on failure
    }
  ]
});
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Chain Design
- **Keep steps focused**: Each step should have a single, clear responsibility
- **Use explicit output keys**: Make data flow transparent
- **Handle errors gracefully**: Choose appropriate error strategies per step
- **Validate dependencies**: Ensure dependency chains are acyclic

### 2. Flow Design
- **Start simple**: Begin with linear flows, add complexity as needed
- **Document conditions**: Make branching logic explicit and testable
- **Limit loop iterations**: Always set max iterations to prevent infinite loops
- **Visualize first**: Use the Mermaid output to communicate flow structure

### 3. Performance
- **Parallel where possible**: Use parallel nodes for independent analyses
- **Cache intermediate results**: Store outputs for reuse in subsequent steps
- **Monitor execution time**: Track bottlenecks in long chains
- **Optimize prompts**: Keep individual prompts concise and focused

### 4. Debugging
- **Enable visualization**: Always generate Mermaid diagrams during development
- **Log intermediate outputs**: Track data flow through the chain/flow
- **Test edge cases**: Validate error handling and edge conditions
- **Use execution guides**: Follow the generated execution instructions

## Performance Optimization Patterns

### 1. Context Window Management

When working with long flows or chains, optimize token usage:

```typescript
// Use memory-context-optimizer between steps
await promptChainingBuilder({
  chainName: "Long Document Analysis",
  steps: [
    {
      name: "Extract Key Points",
      prompt: "Extract main points from document",
      outputKey: "key_points"
    },
    {
      name: "Compress Context",
      prompt: "Use memory-context-optimizer to compress {{key_points}} for next steps",
      dependencies: ["key_points"],
      outputKey: "optimized_context"
    },
    {
      name: "Deep Analysis",
      prompt: "Analyze using compressed context: {{optimized_context}}",
      dependencies: ["optimized_context"]
    }
  ]
});
```

### 2. Parallel Execution for Independent Tasks

Maximize throughput by parallelizing independent operations:

```typescript
await promptFlowBuilder({
  flowName: "Parallel Code Analysis",
  nodes: [
    { id: "start", type: "prompt", name: "Parse Code", config: { prompt: "Parse codebase" } },
    { id: "fork", type: "parallel", name: "Fork Analysis" },
    { id: "security", type: "prompt", name: "Security Scan", config: { prompt: "Security analysis" } },
    { id: "performance", type: "prompt", name: "Performance Check", config: { prompt: "Performance analysis" } },
    { id: "quality", type: "prompt", name: "Quality Metrics", config: { prompt: "Code quality analysis" } },
    { id: "merge", type: "merge", name: "Combine Results" },
    { id: "report", type: "transform", name: "Generate Report", config: { transform: "Combine into report" } }
  ],
  edges: [
    { from: "start", to: "fork" },
    { from: "fork", to: "security" },
    { from: "fork", to: "performance" },
    { from: "fork", to: "quality" },
    { from: "security", to: "merge" },
    { from: "performance", to: "merge" },
    { from: "quality", to: "merge" },
    { from: "merge", to: "report" }
  ]
});
```

### 3. Caching and Reuse

Store intermediate results for reuse across sessions:

```typescript
// Use project-onboarding to cache project analysis
const onboarding = await projectOnboarding({
  projectPath: "/path/to/project",
  includeMemories: true // Stores memories for future use
});

// Reuse cached memories in flows
await promptFlowBuilder({
  flowName: "Incremental Analysis",
  variables: {
    cached_architecture: onboarding.memories.architecture,
    cached_dependencies: onboarding.memories.dependencies
  },
  nodes: [
    {
      id: "incremental_scan",
      type: "prompt",
      name: "Scan Changes Only",
      config: {
        prompt: "Analyze only changes since last run, using {{cached_architecture}}"
      }
    }
  ]
});
```

### 4. Progressive Refinement

Break complex tasks into iterative refinement loops:

```typescript
await promptFlowBuilder({
  flowName: "Iterative Improvement",
  nodes: [
    { id: "draft", type: "prompt", name: "Create Draft", config: { prompt: "Generate initial draft" } },
    { id: "review", type: "prompt", name: "Review Quality", config: { prompt: "Assess quality (1-10)" } },
    { id: "check", type: "condition", name: "Quality Check", config: { expression: "quality >= 8" } },
    { id: "refine", type: "prompt", name: "Refine Draft", config: { prompt: "Improve based on feedback" } },
    { id: "loop", type: "loop", name: "Refinement Loop", config: { iterations: 3, condition: "quality < 8" } },
    { id: "finalize", type: "transform", name: "Finalize", config: { transform: "Polish final version" } }
  ],
  edges: [
    { from: "draft", to: "review" },
    { from: "review", to: "check" },
    { from: "check", to: "finalize", condition: "true", label: "High Quality" },
    { from: "check", to: "refine", condition: "false", label: "Needs Work" },
    { from: "refine", to: "loop" },
    { from: "loop", to: "review" }
  ]
});
```
