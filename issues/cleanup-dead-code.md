### 📝 Summary

This issue is a sub-task of the main test coverage initiative [#64](https://github.com/Anselmoo/mcp-ai-agent-guidelines/issues/64).

Analysis from PR [#66](https://github.com/Anselmoo/mcp-ai-agent-guidelines/pull/66) revealed that a significant amount of dead or unreachable code is preventing an increase in our test coverage metrics. Despite adding over 140 tests, the coverage percentages did not improve, indicating that the uncovered functions are not being used.

### 🎯 Problem

The presence of dead code inflates the complexity of the codebase and skews our test coverage metrics, making it difficult to track real progress. To realistically achieve our Q1 coverage goals, we must first remove this unused code.

### identified Modules

The following modules have been identified as having a high number of uncovered (and likely unused) functions:

-   `coverage-enforcer.ts`
-   `spec-generator.ts`
-   `confirmation-module.ts`
-   `strategic-pivot-prompt-builder.ts`

### ✅ Task

1.  Analyze the modules listed above to identify and confirm which functions are truly dead or unreachable.
2.  Safely remove the identified dead code.
3.  Run the test suite to ensure that the removal does not introduce any regressions.
4.  Verify that the test coverage metrics have improved (or at least not worsened) after the cleanup.

This cleanup is a prerequisite for making meaningful progress on our test coverage goals.
