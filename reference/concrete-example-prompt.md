## Design Direction
The design should feel professional and efficient - clean, modern interface that inspires confidence in data processing with minimal visual distractions to maintain focus on the conversion task.

## Color Selection
Triadic color scheme to create visual hierarchy between different states and actions.

- **Primary Color**: Deep Blue (oklch(0.45 0.15 250)) - Communicates trust and professionalism for data processing
- **Secondary Colors**: Neutral Gray (oklch(0.85 0.02 250)) for backgrounds and supporting elements
- **Accent Color**: Vibrant Green (oklch(0.65 0.18 130)) - Success states, conversion ready, and download actions
- **Foreground/Background Pairings**:
  - Background (White oklch(1 0 0)): Dark Gray text (oklch(0.2 0.02 250)) - Ratio 12.6:1 ✓
  - Card (Light Gray oklch(0.98 0.01 250)): Dark Gray text (oklch(0.2 0.02 250)) - Ratio 11.8:1 ✓
  - Primary (Deep Blue oklch(0.45 0.15 250)): White text (oklch(1 0 0)) - Ratio 8.2:1 ✓
  - Accent (Vibrant Green oklch(0.65 0.18 130)): White text (oklch(1 0 0)) - Ratio 4.9:1 ✓

## Font Selection
Inter font family to convey clarity and technical precision - excellent readability for data-focused applications with clean geometric forms.

- **Typographic Hierarchy**:
  - H1 (App Title): Inter Bold/32px/tight letter spacing
  - H2 (Section Headers): Inter Semibold/24px/normal spacing
  - Body (Instructions): Inter Regular/16px/relaxed line height
  - Code (JSON/CSV): Inter Mono/14px/monospace for data display

## Animations
Subtle and functional animations that provide feedback during file processing and state changes without distracting from the core workflow.

- **Purposeful Meaning**: Smooth transitions communicate processing states and guide users through the conversion workflow
- **Hierarchy of Movement**: File upload gets subtle hover animations, conversion process shows progress, success states have satisfying completion animations

## Component Selection
- **Components**:
  - Card component for main conversion interface
  - Button (primary for convert, secondary for download)
  - Input with file upload styling
  - Alert for error states and success messages
  - Progress component for large file processing
  - Separator to divide workflow sections
- **Customizations**: Custom drag-and-drop zone with dashed borders and hover states
- **States**:
  - Upload area: default, hover, dragover, error, success
  - Convert button: disabled, enabled, processing, complete
  - File preview: collapsed, expanded with syntax highlighting
- **Icon Selection**: Upload, Download, FileText, CheckCircle, AlertTriangle for various states
- **Spacing**: Consistent 4-unit spacing (16px) between major sections, 2-unit (8px) for related elements
- **Mobile**: Single column layout with full-width components, touch-friendly upload targets, collapsible preview section
