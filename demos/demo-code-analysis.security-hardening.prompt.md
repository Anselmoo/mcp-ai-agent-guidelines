# Security Vulnerability Analysis Prompt

Perform comprehensive security analysis of javascript code with focus on vulnerability analysis

## Code Context
Express.js API endpoint handling user authentication and payment processing:

```javascript
app.post('/api/login', (req, res) => {
	const { username, password } = req.body;
	const query = `SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '${username}' AND password = '${password}'`;
	db.query(query, (err, result) => {
		if (result.length > 0) {
			req.session.user = result[0];
			res.json({ success: true, token: result[0].id });
		} else {
			res.json({ success: false });
		}
	});
});

app.post('/api/payment', (req, res) => {
	const { amount, cardNumber, cvv } = req.body;
	// Process payment without validation
	processPayment(amount, cardNumber, cvv);
	res.json({ status: 'processed' });
});
```

## Security Requirements
1. Prevent SQL injection attacks
2. Implement secure session management
3. Validate all user inputs
4. Protect sensitive payment data

## Compliance Standards
Evaluate against:
- OWASP Top-10
- PCI DSS

## Analysis Scope
Focus on these security areas:
- Input Validation
- Authentication
- Authorization
- Data Encryption
- Session Management

## Security Analysis Framework

### 1. Vulnerability Identification
- Scan for common vulnerability patterns (OWASP Top 10)
- Identify insecure coding practices
- Check for hardcoded secrets and credentials
- Analyze input validation and sanitization

### 2. Risk Assessment
- Rate findings by severity (Critical/High/Medium/Low)
- Assess exploitability and business impact
- Consider attack vectors and threat scenarios
- Document risk exposure and likelihood

### 3. Security Controls Evaluation
- Review authentication mechanisms
- Validate authorization and access controls
- Check encryption and data protection
- Assess logging and monitoring coverage

### 4. Remediation Guidance
- Provide specific fix recommendations
- Suggest secure coding alternatives
- Include implementation best practices
- Reference security libraries and frameworks

## Output Format

Provide a comprehensive security assessment report including:
- **Executive Summary**: High-level security posture overview
- **Findings**: Detailed vulnerability descriptions with severity ratings
- **Risk Analysis**: Impact assessment and exploitability analysis
- **Recommendations**: Prioritized remediation steps with implementation guidance
- **Code Examples**: Before/after code snippets showing secure implementations
- **Test Cases**: Security test scenarios to validate fixes

## Risk Tolerance
Apply low risk tolerance:
- Flag all potential security issues, even minor ones
- Recommend defense-in-depth approaches
- Prioritize security over convenience

## Prioritization Criteria
1. **Critical**: Immediate threats with high exploitability
2. **High**: Significant security risks requiring prompt attention
3. **Medium**: Important improvements with moderate risk
4. **Low**: Best practice recommendations with minimal risk
# Technique Hints (2025)

## Prompt Chaining
Split multi-step workflows into sequential prompts (analyze ➜ hypothesize ➜ recommend ➜ plan).
# Model-Specific Tips

- Prefer Markdown with clear headings and sections
- Place instructions at the beginning (and optionally re-assert at the end) in long contexts
- Use explicit step numbering for CoT where helpful

- Preferred Style: MARKDOWN

```md
# Instructions
...your task...

# Context
...data...

# Output Format
JSON fields ...
```

# Pitfalls to Avoid

- Vague instructions → replace with precise, positive directives
- Forced behaviors (e.g., 'always use a tool') → say 'Use tools when needed'
- Context mixing → separate Instructions vs Data clearly
- Limited examples → vary few-shot examples to avoid overfitting
- Repetitive sample phrases → add 'vary language naturally'
- Negative instructions → state what to do, not just what not to do


## Security-Specific Pitfalls to Avoid

- Over-relying on client-side validation → implement server-side validation
- Ignoring principle of least privilege → restrict access to minimum required
- Using deprecated cryptographic algorithms → use current security standards
- Hardcoding sensitive configuration → use secure configuration management
- Insufficient logging of security events → implement comprehensive audit trails
- Assuming internal networks are secure → implement zero-trust principles
