## Risk Management

### Design Coverage Gap (HIGH probability, MEDIUM impact)

**Description**: Incomplete design coverage may lead to rework

**Mitigation**: Complete design phases before implementation

**Contingency**: Iterative design completion during implementation

**Owner**: Design Lead

## Dependencies

### Team Training (MEDIUM criticality)

**Type**: internal
**Status**: pending
**Required By**: impl-milestone-1

**Description**: Team training on new technologies and processes

## Resource Requirements

**Team Composition**:

- Project Manager (1 FTE)
- Technical Lead (1 FTE)
- Senior Developers (2-3 FTE)
- QA Engineer (0.5 FTE)
- DevOps Engineer (0.5 FTE)

**Technology Stack**:

- To be determined during architecture phase

**Budget Considerations**:
