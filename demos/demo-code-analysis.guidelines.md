# Guidelines Validation Report for demo-code-analysis.py

## ✅ AI Agent Development Guidelines Validation

### 📋 Practice Analysis
| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Category | code-management |
| Description | The codebase uses TODO/FIXME tags and print-based debugging. Git hooks and CI checks for linting and tests are not mentioned in this file. There is also insecure patterns like hardcoded secrets and unsafe SQL. |

### 📊 Compliance Assessment
| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Overall Score | 50/100 |
| Compliance Level | FAIR |

🟠 **Fair compliance** - Several areas need attention
