# Context
Refactor a small Python script for clarity and safety

# Goal
Produce a step-by-step refactor plan and a checklist

# Requirements
1. Keep behavior the same
2. Reduce complexity
3. Add docstrings and type hints

# Output Format
1. Summary
2. Steps
3. Checklist

# Target Audience
Senior engineer

# Technique Hints (2025)

## Zero-Shot
Use for simple tasks or baselines. Keep instructions crisp. Example: 'Summarize the following text in 3 bullets focused on findings.'

## Few-Shot
Provide 2â€“5 diverse examples that exactly match the desired output format.

## Chain-of-Thought
Ask for step-by-step reasoning on complex problems. For GPT add 'think carefully step by step'.

## Prompt Chaining
Split multi-step workflows into sequential prompts (analyze âžœ hypothesize âžœ recommend âžœ plan).

## Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)
Separate instructions from documents. Quote sources and include citations/anchors.
# Model-Specific Tips

- Prefer Markdown with clear headings and sections
- Place instructions at the beginning (and optionally re-assert at the end) in long contexts
- Use explicit step numbering for CoT where helpful

- Preferred Style: MARKDOWN

```md
# Instructions
...your task...

# Context
...data...

# Output Format
JSON fields ...
```

# Pitfalls to Avoid

- Vague instructions â†’ replace with precise, positive directives
- Forced behaviors (e.g., 'always use a tool') â†’ say 'Use tools when needed'
- Context mixing â†’ separate Instructions vs Data clearly
- Limited examples â†’ vary few-shot examples to avoid overfitting
- Repetitive sample phrases â†’ add 'vary language naturally'
- Negative instructions â†’ state what to do, not just what not to do

# Instructions
Follow the structure above. If you detect additional issues in the codebase, explicitly add them under Problem Indicators, propose minimal diffs, and flag risky changes. Treat tools/models as recommendations to validate against current provider documentation.

- References to third-party tools, models, pricing, and limits are indicative and may change.
- Validate choices with official docs and run a quick benchmark before production use.
