```md
# Instructions
...your task...

# Context
...data...

# Output Format
JSON fields ...
```

# Instructions
Follow the structure above. If you detect additional issues in the codebase, explicitly add them under Problem Indicators, propose minimal diffs, and flag risky changes. Treat tools/models as recommendations to validate against current provider documentation.

## Disclaimer
- References to third-party tools, models, pricing, and limits are indicative and may change.
- Validate choices with official docs and run a quick benchmark before production use.
