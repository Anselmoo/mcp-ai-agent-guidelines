## ðŸ§­ Hierarchical Prompt Structure

### Metadata

- Source tool: mcp_ai-agent-guid_hierarchical-prompt-builder

# Context
We need a structured prompt to guide a thorough code hygiene assessment and remediation planning for a problematic Python file. Findings should be categorized and prioritized, with security-first focus.

# Goal
Generate a hierarchical prompt that elicits: summary, categorized findings, prioritized risks, and a remediation plan with acceptance checks.

# Requirements
1. Security findings must come first
2. Checklist format for actions
3. Limit verbosityâ€”concise bullets
4. Accepts arbitrary language inputs

# Target Audience
Senior engineers and tech leads

# Technique Hints (2025)

## Few-Shot
Provide 2â€“5 diverse examples that exactly match the desired output format.
# Model-Specific Tips

- Prefer Markdown with clear headings and sections
- Place instructions at the beginning (and optionally re-assert at the end) in long contexts
- Use explicit step numbering for CoT where helpful

- Preferred Style: MARKDOWN

```md
# Instructions
...your task...

# Context
...data...

# Output Format
JSON fields ...
```

# Pitfalls to Avoid

- Vague instructions â†’ replace with precise, positive directives
- Forced behaviors (e.g., 'always use a tool') â†’ say 'Use tools when needed'
- Context mixing â†’ separate Instructions vs Data clearly
- Limited examples â†’ vary few-shot examples to avoid overfitting
- Repetitive sample phrases â†’ add 'vary language naturally'
- Negative instructions â†’ state what to do, not just what not to do

# Instructions
Follow the structure above. If you detect additional issues in the codebase, explicitly add them under Problem Indicators, propose minimal diffs, and flag risky changes. Treat tools/models as recommendations to validate against current provider documentation.
