### üìã Summary
| Key | Value |
|---|---|
| Language | python |
| Framework | none |
| Issues Found | 3 |
| Recommendations | 3 |

### ‚ùó Issues Detected

3. **Dead Code**: Found 28 lines of commented code - consider removing

### üóÇÔ∏è Issues Table
| Type | Description |
|---|---|
| Code Complexity | Deep nesting detected (8 levels) - consider refactoring |
| Technical Debt | Found TODO or FIXME comments indicating incomplete work |
| Dead Code | Found 28 lines of commented code - consider removing |


### ‚úÖ Recommendations
1. Reduce nesting depth by extracting functions or using early returns
2. Address pending TODO and FIXME items before production
3. Remove commented out code or move to version control history

### üßÆ Hygiene Score
**78/100** - Good

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Next Steps
1. Fix 1 major issue(s) before merging
2. Address the identified issues in order of priority (critical > major > minor)
3. Set up automated code quality checks (ESLint, Prettier, Biome, etc.)
4. Consider implementing pre-commit hooks
