## 📈 Component Scores

| Component | Score | Status |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| Clarity | 91/100 | ✅ Excellent |
| Specificity | 100/100 | ✅ Excellent |
| Completeness | 100/100 | ✅ Excellent |
| Structure | 100/100 | ✅ Excellent |
| Hierarchy Match | 50/100 | ⚠️ Fair |
| Cognitive Complexity | 51/100 | 🟡 Medium |

## 💡 Recommendations

🎚️ Adjust hierarchy level: Current level is "Full Physical Guidance", target is "Scaffolding". Remove some detailed instructions or steps to give more autonomy.

## 📚 Hierarchy Level Reference

### Independent
Minimal guidance; agent operates autonomously with broad objectives

**Use Cases**: Highly capable agents, Exploratory tasks, Creative problem solving

### Indirect Guidance
Subtle hints and environmental cues to guide agent behavior

**Use Cases**: Learning scenarios, Skill development, Encouraging best practices

### Direct Instructions
Clear, explicit instructions without detailed steps

**Use Cases**: Standard tasks, Experienced agents, Clear requirements

### Modeling/Demonstration
Provides examples and demonstrations of expected behavior

**Use Cases**: New patterns or technologies, Ensuring consistency, Teaching specific approaches

### Scaffolding
Step-by-step guidance with structured support

**Use Cases**: Complex multi-step tasks, Less experienced agents, Critical procedures

### ✅ Full Physical Guidance
Complete detailed specification with explicit instructions for every step

**Use Cases**: Precise requirements, High-risk operations, Exact replication needed
