# Gap Analysis Framework

Context: DevOps transformation initiative to improve deployment reliability and speed

Current State: Manual deployment processes with limited monitoring and basic CI/CD pipeline

Desired State: Fully automated deployment with comprehensive monitoring, security scanning, and zero-downtime deployments

Objectives:
- Reduce deployment time from 4 hours to 30 minutes
- Achieve 99.9% uptime
- Implement automated security scanning
- Enable multiple deployments per day

Timeframe: 12 months

Stakeholders:
- Development Team
- Operations Team
- Security Team
- Product Management

Constraints:
- Limited downtime windows
- Compliance requirements
- Budget constraints



## Capability Gap Analysis

- Map current capabilities vs required capabilities
- Identify capability maturity levels (basic, proficient, advanced, expert)
- Assess criticality and impact of each gap
- Estimate effort and resources required to close gaps
- Prioritize capabilities by business value and feasibility

## Performance Gap Analysis

- Define current performance metrics and benchmarks
- Establish target performance indicators
- Identify root causes of performance gaps
- Assess impact on business objectives
- Define improvement initiatives and expected outcomes

## Maturity Gap Analysis

- Assess current maturity level (initial, managed, defined, quantitatively managed, optimizing)
- Define target maturity state
- Identify process, people, and technology gaps
- Map maturity improvement roadmap
- Define success criteria and measurement approach

## Technology Gap Analysis

- Assess current technology stack and capabilities
- Define target technology architecture
- Identify technology gaps and legacy constraints
- Evaluate build vs buy vs partner options
- Create technology modernization roadmap

## Gap Closure Action Plan

- **Priority 1 (Critical)**: List immediate actions required
- **Priority 2 (Important)**: List medium-term initiatives
- **Priority 3 (Beneficial)**: List long-term improvements
- **Resource Requirements**: People, budget, technology, time
- **Success Metrics**: KPIs to measure gap closure progress
- **Risk Mitigation**: Identify and address implementation risks
- **Review Schedule**: Regular assessment and adjustment plan
