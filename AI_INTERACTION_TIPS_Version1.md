# AI Interaction Tips: Leveraging Specialized Tools Effectively

## Overview

This guide helps you move beyond generic questions to leverage the full suite of specialized tools available in the MCP AI Agent Guidelines server. By learning how to ask **targeted, tool-oriented questions**, you can achieve better results and unlock capabilities you might not have known were available.

## The Problem with Generic Questions

Many users underutilize the available tools because they ask generic questions that don't naturally map to specific tool capabilities. For example:

❌ **Generic**: "Help me improve my code"
❌ **Generic**: "Analyze this application"
❌ **Generic**: "Create documentation"

While these questions can be answered, they often lead to suboptimal tool selection or incomplete use of specialized features.

## Solution: Targeted Questions That Map to Tools

By formulating more specific questions, you guide the AI to select the most appropriate specialized tools. This section provides concrete examples organized by tool category.

**Tool Used**: `security-hardening-prompt-builder`

#### Dependency Auditing
**Instead of**: "Are my dependencies safe?"

**Ask**:
- "Audit all production dependencies for security vulnerabilities at moderate severity level or higher"
- "Check for outdated dependencies in my package.json and identify which ones have security patches available"
- "Analyze dependency tree for known CVEs and provide upgrade recommendations with risk assessment"

**Tool Used**: `dependency-auditor`

#### Coverage Enhancement
**Instead of**: "Improve test coverage"

**Ask**:
- "Analyze coverage gaps in my test suite (current: 72% lines, 65% branches) and generate specific test suggestions for uncovered code paths"
- "Detect dead code that can be eliminated to improve coverage metrics and reduce maintenance burden"
- "Recommend adaptive coverage thresholds based on project complexity and generate CI/CD integration actions"

**Tool Used**: `iterative-coverage-enhancer`

## Best Practices

### 1. Be Specific About Context
Include relevant details like programming language, framework, domain, and constraints.

✅ **Good**: "Analyze this React TypeScript component for performance issues related to re-renders and hook dependencies"
❌ **Bad**: "Analyze this code"

### 2. Specify Desired Output Format
Many tools support multiple output formats (markdown, JSON, LaTeX, CSV).

✅ **Good**: "Generate a sequence diagram in Mermaid format with dark theme and left-to-right orientation"
❌ **Bad**: "Make a diagram"

### 3. Provide Success Criteria
Help the AI understand what "done" looks like.

✅ **Good**: "Create a hierarchical prompt for API design with requirements for RESTful principles, OpenAPI compliance, and error handling patterns"
❌ **Bad**: "Create a prompt for API design"

### 4. Leverage Composability
Chain multiple tool invocations for complex workflows instead of trying to do everything in one request.

### 5. Use Agent-Relative Call Patterns
When working with multiple MCP servers, use explicit tool references:

```markdown
Use the hierarchical-prompt-builder MCP from AI Agent Guidelines to create the initial structure
Use the GitHub MCP to analyze existing issues and PRs
Use the mermaid-diagram-generator MCP from AI Agent Guidelines to visualize the workflow
```

## Tips for Discovery

### Explore Tool Descriptions
Each tool has a detailed description. Review them to understand capabilities:
- Check tool parameters and what options are available
- Look for examples in the tool descriptions
- Note which parameters are required vs. optional

### Start with Your Goal
Think about what you want to achieve, then reverse-engineer the question:
1. What's the end result I need?
2. What information or format do I need it in?
3. What context is necessary to get a quality result?

### Learn from Examples
This repository includes comprehensive demo files showing tool usage:
- Check `demos/` directory for real examples
- Review `docs/AGENT_RELATIVE_CALLS.md` for workflow patterns
- See `docs/FLOW_PROMPTING_EXAMPLES.md` for advanced chaining

### Iterate and Refine
If the first result isn't perfect:
- Add more context or constraints
- Specify output format preferences
- Break complex requests into smaller steps
