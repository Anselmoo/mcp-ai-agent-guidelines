# Coverage Improvement Summary

## Issue

The project had less than 50% test coverage, specifically:

- Statements: 48.24%
- Functions: 37.85%
- Lines: 48.24%

## Root Cause - The Logic Gap ðŸŽ¯

The agent instructions asked: "why is the design coverage so low, if the module is correctly implemented -- please verify -- then also all modules should be activated during a test. This not happens, there is logic gap"

**The Logic Gap Identified:**
Tests were importing from `dist/` (compiled JavaScript) instead of `src/` (TypeScript source). This prevented V8 coverage from properly mapping executed code back to source files for coverage reporting.

### Why This Happened

1. V8 coverage tracks execution in the compiled JavaScript files
2. It relies on source maps to map coverage back to TypeScript source
3. When tests import from `dist/`, the coverage tool can't properly correlate execution with source files
4. Tests were passing, but coverage wasn't being recorded correctly

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Created Comprehensive Test Suite

Created `tests/vitest/coverage-boost.test.ts` with 22 test cases that exercise:

- Coverage enforcer: All violation paths with `enforceThresholds: true`
- Documentation/test/assumption coverage calculations
- All spec generator types (technical, functional, API, architecture, implementation)
- Roadmap generator with all options and granularities
- Confirmation module validation methods
- Constraint consistency enforcer
- Strategic pivot prompt builder with different complexities

### 2. Fixed Import Paths

Changed imports from:

```typescript
import { coverageEnforcer } from "../../dist/tools/design/coverage-enforcer.js";
```

to:

```typescript
import { coverageEnforcer } from "../../src/tools/design/coverage-enforcer.js";
```
