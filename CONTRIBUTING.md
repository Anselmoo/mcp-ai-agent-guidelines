## ðŸ¤– GitHub Copilot & AI Assistants

For comprehensive development guidelines when using GitHub Copilot or other AI coding assistants, see **[.github/copilot-instructions.md](./.github/copilot-instructions.md)**. This document contains detailed instructions for maintaining code quality and following project standards.

## Quick Start

- Open an issue to discuss large changes.
- Use Node.js 20+, run `npm ci` before development.
- Ensure quality gates pass:
  - `npm run check`
  - `npm run type-check`
  - `npm run test:all`
- Include or update tests for behavior changes.
- Keep docs current (README, demos/README).

## Commit and PR
- Use clear, conventional commit messages if possible.
- Link to related issues (e.g., Fixes #123).
- Fill out the PR template.

## Releases
- For new releases, use the [Release Setup Issue Form](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/release-setup.yml)
- The form enables automation and ensures all version updates are captured
- Maintainers will handle the actual release process after form submission
